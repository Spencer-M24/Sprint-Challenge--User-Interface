If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

In HTML you use semantic html or also known as markup. The best parts of using semantic is when adding semantic tags to your document you let others know information about your code which helps in communciation. Also they talk with search engines, making sure the right pages get sent and recived for the rigth queries. So in summary Semantic Html is a good way of giving understanding to your code so other can comprehend what it means. Semantic explains what a elements does for a website and a team of developers and software enginnners or to any one learning to code. A good visual example is on websites you see on top of the page there sections, you see in the code labeled sections it might be confusing if your code just has a bunch of sections. A good way to organize your code and explain it is a section can be a nav which means navigation. It will help developers and people code much more fluently, kinda like a CAR there many parts of a car but which part in the engine needs to be worked on needs to have meaning so you can solve the specfic issue.

Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

Git is a great tool if your on a team with web developer or software engineers it can be helpful. WHy because when you collaborate you can send and watch eachother code. Everyone can have create their  own branch. That is much better for everyone because the code wont mess up. because you will have your own code  that you push and other can see it and make changes instead of working on one code and mess everything up. So in summary a team can make differnt branches that they can work on. And not interfer with other people code and not ruining others work.
